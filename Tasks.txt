Network Metrics:
  - Diameter
  - Average Path Length
  - Clustering Coefficient
  - Centrality
    * Closeness
    * Betweeness
    * Degree
    * Eigenvector
  - Conductance

Metrics we will actually do:
  - Conductance
  - Clustering Coefficient
  - Some type of centrality (degree? closeness/avg path length?)

Felipe:
  * Conductance

Bryson:
  * Clustering Coefficient

Alex:
  * Avg Path Length 
  * Closeness Centrality
  * Diameter


Next Meeting Monday
  - Have something done

Network Representation:
  - Numpy double array
